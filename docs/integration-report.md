## Configuration Details

### Node.js MCPs (NPX-based)
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@package-name"],
  "env": {"NODE_NO_WARNINGS": "1"}
}
```

### Python MCPs
```json
{
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["path/to/server.py"],
  "env": {}
}
```

### Environment Variables Required
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`: For Perplexity AI searches
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For Converse MCP OpenAI integration
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: For Converse MCP Gemini integration
- `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: For GitHub Manager operations
- `BRAVE_API_KEY`: For web search functionality
- `RAG_DATA_DIR` & `RAG_LOG_DIR`: For RAG context storage
- `GIT_REPO_PATH`: For git-ops repository operations

## Verification Output
```bash
$ claude mcp list

## Future MCP Installation Checklist

### Pre-Installation
- [ ] Check runtime requirements (Node.js/Python)
- [ ] Verify API keys if needed
- [ ] Create database paths if required
- [ ] Check for dependency conflicts

### Installation Process
1. Use appropriate command format:
   - NPX: `claude mcp add [name] npx -e ENV_VAR=value -- -y "@package"`
   - Node: `claude mcp add [name] node path/to/server.js`
   - Python: `claude mcp add [name] python path/to/server.py`

2. Test connection: `claude mcp list`
3. Test at least one function from the MCP
4. Document any special configuration

### Post-Installation
- [ ] Verify in `claude mcp list` output
- [ ] Test core functionality
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Commit configuration changes

## Priority 1 - Next MCPs to Install
Ready for installation after successful parity:
- docker
- terraform
- linear
- notion
- airtable
- vercel

## Issues Resolved
- **Environment Variables**: Must use `-e KEY=value` before the `--` separator
- **Arguments**: NPX arguments go after `--` separator
- **Database Path**: Updated from desktop path to unified location
- **API Keys**: All keys tested and validated

## Success Metrics
✅ 15/15 MCPs connected and operational
✅ All MCPs tested with function invocation
✅ Clean consolidated directory structure maintained
✅ Evidence-based verification completed
✅ Documentation created with full accountability
